# Directory Submission Marketing Strategy
## Add-on to PixelPorts MVP Roadmap

**INSERT THIS SECTION AFTER "Seeding Strategy" and BEFORE "Success Metrics"**

## Directory Submission Strategy (Post-Launch Marketing)

### **Research-Backed Approach (Based on 5K Directory Audit)**

**Timeline: Weeks 5-8 (Post-Launch)**  
**Goal: Get discovered by designers actively searching for portfolio platforms**

### **The Reality Check:**
Out of 5,000+ directories analyzed, only ~420 (8%) actually deliver:
- Google indexing of your profile
- Real referral traffic
- Approval and publication
- Searchable presence

**Key Insight:** Directory submissions work, but 92% are a waste of time. Focus on the 8% that matter.

---

### **Directories That Actually Work for PixelPorts:**

#### **Tier 1 - High Priority (Weeks 5-6):**
- [ ] **Product Hunt** - Launch day essential (design community watches)
- [ ] **BetaList** - New startup visibility
- [ ] **Indie Hackers** - Founder-focused, engaged audience
- [ ] **Designer News** - Core target audience
- [ ] **Hacker News "Show HN"** - If execution is strong
- [ ] Research and submit to 10-15 **niche design tool aggregators**:
    - "Best portfolio platforms"
    - "Design tools for freelancers"
    - "Portfolio builders comparison"
    - SaaS review sites with design categories

#### **Tier 2 - SaaS/Product Catalogs (Week 7):**
- [ ] Research 20-30 SaaS directories that:
    - Create dedicated profile pages
    - Include you in curated "best tools" lists
    - Have active editorial teams
    - Rank for relevant search terms
- [ ] Examples to research:
    - **Capterra** (SaaS marketplace)
    - **G2** (Software reviews)
    - **AlternativeTo** (Software alternatives)
    - **Slant** (Product comparisons)
    - **GetApp** (Software discovery)
- [ ] **Why:** Lower volume but higher intent users

#### **Tier 3 - Community Lists (Week 8):**
- [ ] Find Notion/Airtable "Best Design Tools" lists via Google:
    - Search: "best portfolio tools notion"
    - Search: "design resources airtable"
    - Check Twitter for curator accounts
- [ ] Search for GitHub awesome-lists related to design/portfolios:
    - awesome-design-tools
    - awesome-portfolio
    - awesome-web-design
- [ ] Designer community resource pages:
    - Reddit r/web_design wiki
    - Discord server resource channels
    - Design community Slack workspaces
- [ ] **Why:** Some rank surprisingly well + community trust

#### **Tier 4 - Ongoing (Monthly Maintenance):**
- [ ] Monitor design newsletters for "tool roundup" opportunities
- [ ] Engage with curators on Twitter/LinkedIn
- [ ] Request inclusion in updated "best of" lists
- [ ] Pitch to design bloggers for reviews

---

### **What to AVOID (The 4,300 Waste-of-Time Sites):**

#### **âŒ Skip These Entirely:**
- **Parked/resurrected domains** built purely for ads
- **"Submit your startup" sites** with noindex templates (Google can't find them)
- **JavaScript-only profile links** (Google can't index)
- **Generic "1,000+ startups" link farms** with zero curation
- **Sites that don't rank for their own name** on Google
- **Directories requiring paid placement** just to appear
- **Expired domains** with broken submission forms
- **Template sites** that auto-publish without review

**Sniff Test:** If a directory doesn't rank for its own brand name in Google, it won't help you rank either.

**Quick Check:**
1. Google the directory name
2. Does it appear in first 3 results?
3. Does it have real traffic (check SimilarWeb/Ahrefs free)
4. Are other profiles actually indexed? (Search: `site:directoryname.com`)

---

### **Submission Best Practices (Critical for Success):**

#### **1. Pacing & Variance (Week 5-8 Spread):**
- [ ] **DON'T:** Blast 500 submissions in one day
- [ ] **DO:** Spread 40-60 submissions over 2-4 weeks
- [ ] **WHY:** Looks natural, gives time to track results, avoids spam flags
- [ ] Submit 2-3 per day, rotating through different directory types
- [ ] Wait 48-72 hours between submitting to similar directories

**Schedule Example:**
- **Week 5:** Product Hunt launch + 10 high-priority directories
- **Week 6:** 15-20 SaaS catalogs + 5 design directories
- **Week 7:** 15-20 community lists + niche aggregators
- **Week 8:** Follow-ups, remaining targets, maintenance

#### **2. Description Variance:**
- [ ] Create 5-7 variations of your pitch (not exact copies)
- [ ] Use brand and partial-match keywords (not exact-match spam)
- [ ] Mix descriptions based on directory audience:
    - **For designers:** "Portfolio platform built for emerging designers"
    - **For comparison sites:** "Fast, free alternative to Dribbble and Behance"
    - **For startup dirs:** "Helping designers get discovered and hired"
    - **For SaaS dirs:** "Portfolio builder with analytics and custom domains"
- [ ] Vary length: some 1-sentence, some 2-3 sentences
- [ ] **Why:** Human randomness helps with approvals AND indexing

**Description Template Variations:**

**Version 1 (Short & Direct):**
"Portfolio platform for emerging designers. Show your work, get discovered, build your career. Free forever with optional Pro tools."

**Version 2 (Feature-Focused):**
"PixelPorts helps designers create beautiful portfolios in minutes. Flexible uploads from quick shots to full case studies. Never gate visibilityâ€”discovery is always free."

**Version 3 (Pain Point):**
"Tired of 20-second portfolio load times? PixelPorts is fast, clean, and built for emerging designers who need visibility to build their careers."

**Version 4 (Anti-Positioning):**
"Like Dribbble, but built for emerging talent. Your work gets discovered from day one, not after you've built 1000 followers."

**Version 5 (Value Prop):**
"The portfolio platform that actually helps you get seen. Smart discovery algorithms boost emerging designers, not just popular accounts."

#### **3. Manual Submission (No Auto-Tools):**
- [ ] Add screenshots manually (shows real human submitted)
- [ ] Choose correct categories yourself
- [ ] Write custom descriptions per directory
- [ ] Request inclusion in relevant curated collections
- [ ] Keep 20-30% of work manual (tune categories, ask for collections)
- [ ] Add tags thoughtfully (not keyword stuffing)
- [ ] **Why:** Shows legitimacy, increases approval rate, better placement

**Auto-tools get:**
- Lower approval rates
- Generic placements
- Miss curator opportunities

**Manual submissions get:**
- Higher approval rates (60-80% vs 20-40%)
- Better category placement
- Curator attention
- Collection inclusion

#### **4. Submit the Right URL:**
- [ ] **Homepage** (`pixelports.com`) â†’ For general "portfolio platforms" directories
- [ ] **For Designers page** (`pixelports.com/for-designers`) â†’ For design-specific directories (create if needed)
- [ ] **Pricing page** (`pixelports.com/pricing`) â†’ For comparison sites
- [ ] **Featured work** (`pixelports.com/?tab=featured`) â†’ For showcasing quality
- [ ] **About/Story** (`pixelports.com/about`) â†’ For founder story directories
- [ ] **Why:** If a list ranks for "best portfolio tools for freelancers," send them to a page that answers that specific intent

**Strategy:**
- Match URL to directory's audience intent
- Create landing pages for top 5-10 directories if needed
- Track which URLs get best conversion per directory type

#### **5. Asset Preparation (Week 4 - Before Submissions):**

**Must-Have Assets:**
- [ ] **3-5 high-quality screenshots** (1920x1080 or 1200x800):
    1. Homepage hero with featured work
    2. Discovery tabs (show "New Designers" tab)
    3. Individual portfolio example (show real user)
    4. Upload flow (show flexibility - simple to detailed)
    5. Analytics dashboard (if Pro feature is live)

- [ ] **OG image optimized** for social sharing:
    - Size: 1200x630px
    - Text readable at thumbnail size
    - Branded but not cluttered
    - Test on Twitter, LinkedIn, Slack previews

- [ ] **Favicon** that stands out:
    - 32x32px and 16x16px versions
    - Recognizable even tiny
    - Works on light and dark backgrounds

- [ ] **Logo assets:**
    - PNG with transparent background
    - SVG for scalability
    - Light and dark versions
    - Square icon version
    - Horizontal lockup version

- [ ] **1-minute demo video** (optional but helps):
    - Screen recording of key flow
    - Upload â†’ Portfolio â†’ Discovery
    - No audio needed (add captions)
    - Host on YouTube/Vimeo
    - Embed-friendly

**Nice-to-Have:**
- [ ] Animated GIF of upload flow (30 seconds, < 5MB)
- [ ] Product screenshots in different devices (mobile, tablet)
- [ ] Before/After comparison (old way vs PixelPorts way)

---

### **Tracking & Measurement (Essential):**

#### **Set Up Before Starting (Week 5):**

**Analytics Setup:**
- [ ] **Google Search Console** - Track indexed pages
    - Add property for pixelports.com
    - Submit sitemap
    - Monitor "Coverage" for directory backlinks

- [ ] **UTM parameters** for each directory:
    - Format: `?utm_source=producthunt&utm_medium=directory&utm_campaign=launch`
    - Create tracking spreadsheet with pre-built URLs
    - Use bit.ly or similar for cleaner links (optional)

- [ ] **Analytics dashboard** - Track referral sources:
    - Google Analytics or PostHog
    - Custom report: "Directory Referrals"
    - Track: sessions, signups, uploads from each source

- [ ] **Spreadsheet tracker** (Master Directory List):

| Directory Name | Category | Submitted Date | Status | Profile URL | Indexed? | Month 1 Traffic | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Product Hunt | Tier 1 | 2025-02-01 | Live | url | Yes | 47 visits | Featured on homepage |
| BetaList | Tier 1 | 2025-02-03 | Pending | - | - | - | Waiting approval |
| Generic Directory | Skip | - | Rejected | - | No | - | Noindex site, waste of time |

**Columns to track:**
- Directory name
- Tier (1-4) or "Skip"
- Submission date
- Approval date (or rejected)
- Profile URL (once live)
- Indexed by Google? (check: `site:directoryname.com pixelports`)
- Referral traffic (month 1, month 2, month 3)
- Status (approved/pending/rejected/dead/removed)
- Notes (curator contact, featured in collection, etc.)

#### **Track Three Milestones Separately:**

**Why Separate Tracking Matters:**
Last-click attribution misses the full picture. A designer might:
1. See you in a directory (doesn't click)
2. Google "pixelports review" later (awareness created)
3. Visit directly and sign up (directory gets zero credit)

**Track All Three:**

1. **Approvals** - Did they publish your profile?
    - Success rate: 60-80% for good directories
    - Red flag: <40% approval rate (descriptions too spammy)

2. **Published pages** - Is your profile actually live?
    - Check manually within 1 week
    - Some "approve" but never publish
    - Some publish on subdomains (still counts)

3. **Indexed pages** - Can Google find it?
    - Check: `site:directoryname.com pixelports` in Google
    - Use Google Search Console "Links" report
    - Takes 1-4 weeks typically
    - **Most important metric** for SEO value

#### **Expected Results (Realistic Targets):**

**Week 8 (End of Campaign):**
- [ ] **60 submissions** total (spread over 4 weeks)
- [ ] **40 live listings** (67% approval rate)
- [ ] **25-30 indexed by Google** (use Search Console)
- [ ] **5-8 new backlinks** showing in Search Console
- [ ] **10-25% lift** in referrals from long-tail keywords
- [ ] **Brand queries easier to rank** ("pixelports portfolio")

**Month 2-3 (Compounding Effects):**
- [ ] Directory traffic: 50-150 visits/month (10-20% of organic)
- [ ] Brand search increase: 15-30%
- [ ] Backlink profile: 30-40 quality links
- [ ] "Portfolio platform" rankings: Page 2-3 â†’ Page 1

**Don't Expect:**
- Instant viral traffic (this is a slow build)
- Every directory to work (8% will drive 80% of results)
- Rankings overnight (takes 2-3 months)
- Huge direct traffic (value is in discovery + SEO compound)

---

### **Ongoing Maintenance (Monthly After Week 8):**

#### **Every 30 Days:**

- [ ] **Prune dead profiles**
    - Remove listings from zombie directories
    - Update status in tracker: "Removed" or "Dead site"
    - Don't waste time maintaining bad listings

- [ ] **Refresh screenshots**
    - Keep content current (especially after feature updates)
    - Show social proof ("Now 500+ designers")
    - Update metrics and testimonials

- [ ] **Ask for collection inclusion**
    - Email curators: "Hey, would you consider adding us to your 'Best Free Portfolio Tools' roundup?"
    - Provide fresh angle: "We just hit 500 designers" or "New Pro features"
    - Be genuinely helpful, not spammy

- [ ] **Respond to comments/reviews**
    - If directories allow Q&A, answer questions
    - Thank reviewers (positive or constructive)
    - Address concerns publicly

- [ ] **Update descriptions**
    - Add social proof as you grow: "Now 500+ designers"
    - Highlight new features: "New: Custom domains and PDF export"
    - Keep it fresh (signals activity)

- [ ] **Monitor for new directories**
    - Set Google Alert: "portfolio platform directory"
    - Check competitors' backlinks (Ahrefs free)
    - New directories launch constantly

**Why Maintenance Matters:**
- Curated collections get 5-10x more clicks than general listings
- Updated profiles signal activity â†’ better placement
- Fresh content â†’ re-indexed by Google â†’ ranking boost
- Engaged listings â†’ editors promote more

---

### **Special Notes:**

#### **On "NoFollow" Profiles:**

**Don't Panic About NoFollow Links:**
- [ ] NoFollow profiles **can still help** with discovery and brand queries
- [ ] They add legitimacy and trust signals
- [ ] Google says they *may* still pass some value
- [ ] **Focus question:** Does it send relevant traffic and build brand awareness?

**When to Accept NoFollow:**
- High-traffic directory (Product Hunt, Designer News)
- Dedicated profile page with good content
- Curated collection inclusion
- Active community engagement

**When to Skip NoFollow:**
- Generic link farm
- No real traffic
- Low-quality site
- No profile page (just a link)

#### **On Budget:**

**Free Approach (MVP Budget):**
- **Time investment:** 10-15 hours over 4 weeks
- **Cost:** $0 (all free directory submissions)
- **Focus:** Manual quality over quantity
- **Tools needed:** Spreadsheet, Google Search Console (free)

**Paid Boost (Optional - Month 3+):**
- **Featured Product Hunt launch:** $0 (organic, but can pay for newsletter feature)
- **Paid features on 3-5 top directories:** $500-1,500 total
    - G2 Premium Profile: ~$500/year
    - Capterra Featured Listing: ~$300/month
    - GetApp Premium: ~$400/month
- **Only if:** You have early traction and Pro conversions to justify spend

**ROI Calculation (Month 3):**
- Paid feature: $300/month
- Brings 50 visitors â†’ 5 signups â†’ 1 Pro user = $8/month
- **Not worth it yet**

**Wait until:**
- 10%+ conversion rate (paid traffic â†’ Pro)
- $500+ MRR from Pro
- Proven unit economics

## Conclusion

**The Bottom Line:**

Directory submissions are **boring but effective** early marketing. They won't make you viral, but they'll:
- Build your backlink foundation
- Increase brand awareness
- Drive consistent, if modest, referral traffic
- Establish credibility and social proof

**For PixelPorts specifically**, this aligns perfectly with your mission: helping emerging designers get *discovered*. You're not just *using* directories for marketingâ€”you're *embodying* the same principle you're selling: **good work deserves to be seen**, not just work from people with 10,000 followers.
